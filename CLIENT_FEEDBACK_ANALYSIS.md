# Client Feedback Analysis & Solutions

## Issues Identified from Client Feedback

### 1. **General Audience Publications Ranking Too High for Security Content**

**Problem**: Major general audience/business publications (Atlantic, TIME, Boston Globe, AdAge, National Geographic, Inc.) were ranking very high (80%+) for cybersecurity/CISO pitches when they should be secondary to pure security/tech trades.

**Root Causes**:
- Insufficient domain-specific filtering in the scoring algorithm
- Base semantic similarity scores were too high for general publications
- Domain adjustments were applied as multipliers, so high base scores remained high
- No "hard cutoff" for major vertical mismatches

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Enhanced Outlet Categorization**: Added comprehensive outlet categorization system with 5 categories:
  - `cybersecurity_specialized`: Pure security outlets (Dark Reading, SecurityWeek, etc.)
  - `tech_specialized`: Technology-focused outlets (TechCrunch, Wired, etc.)
  - `business_general`: Business publications (Fortune, WSJ, etc.)
  - `general_interest`: General audience publications (TIME, National Geographic, etc.)
  - `marketing_advertising`: Marketing/advertising outlets (AdAge, AdWeek, etc.)

- **Stronger Domain Multipliers**: Implemented aggressive scoring multipliers:
  - Cybersecurity content: 100% boost for cybersecurity outlets, 90% penalty for general interest
  - Fintech content: 70% penalty for cybersecurity outlets, 80% penalty for general interest

- **Last-Mile Relevance Check**: Added filtering system that applies 95% penalty to major vertical mismatches unless they have recent relevant coverage

### 2. **Match Percentages Too Similar (78-87%)**

**Problem**: All match percentages were bunched together, making it difficult to differentiate between outlets.

**Root Causes**:
- Field weights were too balanced (most between 1.5-5.0)
- Normalization process reduced score differentiation
- No exponential or logarithmic scaling to create spread

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Logarithmic Score Scaling**: Applied logarithmic transformation to create better score differentiation
- **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**: Enhanced weights based on domain context:
  - Cybersecurity: Increased Industry Match (6.0), Keywords (5.5), Audience (6.0)
  - Reduced Prestige importance (0.5) for cybersecurity content
- **Enhanced Sorting**: Added domain-specific tie-breaking with tiny adjustments (0.001) for better ranking

### 3. **Inappropriate Outlets Appearing (National Geographic, AdAge)**

**Problem**: Outlets like National Geographic and AdAge were appearing for technical security pitches without recent relevant coverage.

**Root Causes**:
- No outlet categorization system to identify general vs specialized outlets
- No recent coverage analysis to justify inclusion of general outlets
- Semantic matching gave high scores to tangentially related outlets

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Comprehensive Outlet Categorization**: Automatic categorization based on outlet name, keywords, and audience
- **Recent Coverage Analysis**: Check last 10 articles for domain-relevant keywords
- **Major Vertical Mismatch Filtering**: 95% penalty for general interest outlets in cybersecurity content unless they have recent security coverage

## Technical Implementation Details

### New Methods Added:

1. **`_categorize_outlet(outlet)`**: Categorizes outlets into 5 specialized categories
2. **`_apply_last_mile_relevance_check(outlet, score, domain_context, query)`**: Filters major vertical mismatches
3. **`_check_recent_relevant_coverage(outlet, domain)`**: Analyzes recent articles for domain relevance
4. **`_apply_enhanced_sorting(matches, domain_context)`**: Domain-aware sorting with tie-breaking

### Enhanced Methods:

1. **`_apply_domain_adjustments()`**: Now uses outlet categorization and stronger multipliers
2. **`calculate_comprehensive_score()`**: Dynamic weight adjustment based on domain context
3. **`find_matches()`**: Enhanced sorting and better debugging output

### Configuration Changes:

- **Outlet Categories**: Comprehensive list of outlets by category
- **Domain Multipliers**: Aggressive scoring adjustments for different domain/outlet combinations
- **Field Weights**: Dynamic adjustment based on content domain

## Expected Results

### For Cybersecurity Content:
- **Cybersecurity outlets** (Dark Reading, SecurityWeek, etc.): 100% boost, should rank 90%+
- **Tech outlets** (TechCrunch, Wired, etc.): 20% boost, should rank 70-85%
- **Business outlets** (Fortune, WSJ, etc.): 70% penalty, should rank 30-50%
- **General interest** (TIME, National Geographic, etc.): 90% penalty, should rank 10-25%

### Score Differentiation:
- **Before**: Scores bunched at 78-87%
- **After**: Scores should spread across 10-95% range with clear differentiation

### Inappropriate Outlet Filtering:
- **Before**: National Geographic, AdAge appearing in top results
- **After**: These outlets should be filtered out unless they have recent cybersecurity coverage

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with cybersecurity pitch**: Verify specialized outlets rank highest
2. **Test with fintech pitch**: Verify business/tech outlets rank highest
3. **Check score distribution**: Ensure scores are well-differentiated (not bunched)
4. **Verify filtering**: Confirm inappropriate outlets are properly penalized

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and test** the enhanced algorithm
2. **Monitor results** for cybersecurity and fintech pitches
3. **Collect feedback** on score differentiation and outlet ranking
4. **Fine-tune multipliers** if needed based on real-world results
